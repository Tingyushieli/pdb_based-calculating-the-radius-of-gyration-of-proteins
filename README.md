# pdb_based-calculating-the-radius-of-gyration-of-proteins
provide a primary way to calculate the radius of gyration of proteins basing on its .pdb file.
as you know, the radius of gyration is defined as

$$
  rg=\frac{\Sigma{m_i(R_i-R_C)^{2}}}{\Sigma{m_i}}
$$

I provide a little file to calculate proteins' rg from their pdb file.There are also some pdb files as examples.
I will be very happy if you feel it's of something useful.
Maybe you can give me some suggestions and I will be more than appreciation.
